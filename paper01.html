                <li><strong>Summary:</strong>
                    <p>Focused on vanishing gradient problem, a common issue in deeper architecture of CNN,
                    Some methods are discussed which have skip connections to mitigate this problem.
                        example: ResNets with residual connections, Highway Networks with identity connections, 
                        Stochastic Depth technique to create shorter path for gradient flow by dropping layers & 
                        FractalNets</p>
                    <p>In this paper DenseNet is used where each layer is connected to every other layer in a feed-forward manner(without backward connections)
                        unlike typical CNN where each layer is connected only to its immediate successor, leading to dense connectivity;
                        which actually reduces the number of parameters compared to traditional architectures, here also 
                        Skip-connections are used. Unlike in ResNets, where the features from earlier layers are summed (residual connections),
                        DenseNet concatenates the features of previous layers by stacking them together into a larger feature map.</p>
